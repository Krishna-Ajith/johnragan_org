  <h1>This is an h1 title</h1>
  <p>Notice the gap between it and this paragraph.  It can be removed.</p>
  <h1 class="adjacent">This is another h1 title</h1>
  <p>Here, the gap is removed using an adjacent select of h1 + p, with a margin-top of 0, and a margin-bottom of 0 for h1.  However, this approach does not work for IE as it does not support adjacent selectors.</p>
  <h1 class="ie-specific">An approach for Internet Explorer</h1>
  <p>Here is an IE-compatible approach using a negative margin-bottom on h1.</p>
  <h1>Adjacent Paragraphs</h1>
  <p>Notice that</p>
  <p>adjacent paragraphs</p>
  <p>have gaps as well.</p>
  <h1>We can fix this using no top margins</h1>
  <p class="no_top_margin">Notice that</p>
  <p class="no_top_margin">adjacent paragraphs</p>
  <p class="no_top_margin">have gaps as well.</p>
